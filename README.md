## Today I learned this about AI Agents

I'm exploring the world of AI agents.

As I find interesting open source Python code that's relevant to AI agents,
I'll publish it here.

I'll be adding simple agent implementations and useful tool functions that you can call
from any tool-enabled LLM. My focus is on code that will run locally using Ollama.

I'm assuming that you are familiar with Python. Jupyter notebooks, and the basics of LLMs.

### Installation

The instructions are for a Linux environment, as that is I use.

You'll need a recent installation of Python (3.10+).

You'll need to install Jupyter notebook and the packages in requirements.

```shell
pip install notebook
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once ollama is installed, you will need to pull the models that are used in the notebook(s)
that you want to run.

### LICENCES

My code is released under the MIT licence.
Some notebooks are derived from the work of others, in which case they will specify
the licence under which the code was released.

### How to contribute

Please raise a GitHub issue for problems and suggested enhancements.

If you can solve a problem or add value, I'd love a pull request.

If you need to contact me for any other reason, I am romilly dot cocking at google dot com.
