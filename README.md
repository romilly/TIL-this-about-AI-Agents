## Today I learned this about AI Agents

Here is the code described in [this article on medium](https://medium.com/@romillyc/building-a-minimalist-ai-agent-2053e26dabba?source=friends_link&sk=226f9b2a1e64b608394aaa9cc9f93d5d).
That's a friend link, so you can read it even if you're not a member.
I'm assuming that you are familiar with Python. Jupyter notebooks, and the basics of LLMs.

### Installation

The instructions are for a Linux environment, as that is what I'm used to.

You'll need a recent installation of Python (3.10+).

You'll need to install Jupyter notebook and the packages in requirements.

```shell
pip install notebook
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Once ollama is installed, you will need to pull the model phi4 used in the notebook.

### LICENCES

My code is released under the MIT licence.
The notebooks is derived from the work of others; it specifies
the licence under which the code was released.

### How to contribute

Please raise a GitHub issue for problems and suggested enhancements.

If you can solve a problem or add value, I'd love a pull request.

If you need to contact me for any other reason, I am romilly dot cocking at google dot com.
